<h1>TuneableTrackAttribute</h1>
<code><span class="keyword">enum</span> <span class="keyword">class </span><span class="identifier">TuneableTrackAttribute</span></code>
<p>Describes a track attribute</p>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p><a name="attribute"></a>
<code>attribute</code> - the spotify id for the track attribute</p>
<h3>Enum Values</h3>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><a href="-a-c-o-u-s-t-i-c-n-e-s-s.html">ACOUSTICNESS</a></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic.
1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><a href="-d-a-n-c-e-a-b-i-l-i-t-y.html">DANCEABILITY</a></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical
elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is
least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><a href="-d-u-r-a-t-i-o-n_-i-n_-m-i-l-l-i-s-e-c-o-n-d-s.html">DURATION_IN_MILLISECONDS</a></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The duration of the track in milliseconds.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><a href="-e-n-e-r-g-y.html">ENERGY</a></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity.
Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy,
while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute
include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><a href="-i-n-s-t-r-u-m-e-n-t-a-l-n-e-s-s.html">INSTRUMENTALNESS</a></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as
instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”. The
closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains
no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but
confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><a href="-k-e-y.html">KEY</a></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The key the track is in. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation.
E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><a href="-l-i-v-e-n-e-s-s.html">LIVENESS</a></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased
probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood
that the track is live.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><a href="-l-o-u-d-n-e-s-s.html">LOUDNESS</a></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the
entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the
quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude).
Values typical range between -60 and 0 db.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><a href="-m-o-d-e.html">MODE</a></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its
melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><a href="-p-o-p-u-l-a-r-i-t-y.html">POPULARITY</a></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The popularity of the track. The value will be between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular.
The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of
plays the track has had and how recent those plays are. Note: When applying track relinking via
the market parameter, it is expected to find relinked tracks with popularities that do not match
min_*, max_<em>and target</em> popularities. These relinked tracks are accurate replacements for unplayable tracks with the expected popularity scores. Original, non-relinked tracks are available via the linked_from attribute of the relinked track response.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><a href="-s-p-e-e-c-h-i-n-e-s-s.html">SPEECHINESS</a></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the
recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above
0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66
describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including
such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like
tracks.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><a href="-t-e-m-p-o.html">TEMPO</a></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the
speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><a href="-t-i-m-e_-s-i-g-n-a-t-u-r-e.html">TIME_SIGNATURE</a></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>An estimated overall time signature of a track. The time signature (meter)
is a notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><a href="-v-a-l-e-n-c-e.html">VALENCE</a></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high
valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence
sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).</p>
