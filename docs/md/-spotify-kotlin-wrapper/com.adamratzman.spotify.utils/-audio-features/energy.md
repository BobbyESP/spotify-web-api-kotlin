# energy

`val energy: `[`Float`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-float/index.html)

Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and
activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy,
while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include
dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.
