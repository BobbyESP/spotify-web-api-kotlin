`val bars: `[`List`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/-list/index.html)`<`[`TimeInterval`](../-time-interval/index.md)`>`

The time intervals of the bars throughout the track. A bar (or measure) is a segment of time defined as
a given number of beats. Bar offsets also indicate downbeats, the first beat of the measure.
