# ENERGY

`ENERGY`

Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity.
Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy,
while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute
include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.
