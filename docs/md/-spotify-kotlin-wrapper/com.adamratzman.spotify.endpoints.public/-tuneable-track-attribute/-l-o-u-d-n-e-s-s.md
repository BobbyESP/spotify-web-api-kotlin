# LOUDNESS

`LOUDNESS`

The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the
entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the
quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude).
Values typical range between -60 and 0 db.
