Create a playlist for a Spotify user. (The playlist will be empty until you add tracks.)

### Parameters

`user` - The userâ€™s Spotify user ID.

`name` - The name for the new playlist, for example "Your Coolest Playlist" . This name does not need to be
unique; a user may have several playlists with the same name.

`description` -

`public` - Defaults to true . If true the playlist will be public, if false it will be private.
To be able to create private playlists, the user must have granted the playlist-modify-private scope.

`collaborative` - Defaults to false . If true the playlist will be collaborative. Note that to create a
collaborative playlist you must also set public to false . To create collaborative playlists you must have
granted playlist-modify-private and playlist-modify-public scopes.

**Return**
The created [Playlist](../../com.adamratzman.spotify.utils/-playlist/index.md) object with no tracks
