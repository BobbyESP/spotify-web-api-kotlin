# reorderPlaylistTracks

`fun reorderPlaylistTracks(playlist: `[`String`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-string/index.html)`, reorderRangeStart: `[`Int`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-int/index.html)`, reorderRangeLength: `[`Int`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-int/index.html)`? = null, insertionPoint: `[`Int`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-int/index.html)`, snapshotId: `[`String`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-string/index.html)`? = null): `[`SpotifyRestAction`](../../com.adamratzman.spotify.main/-spotify-rest-action/index.md)`<`[`Snapshot`](-snapshot/index.md)`>`

Reorder a track or a group of tracks in a playlist.

When reordering tracks, the timestamp indicating when they were added and the user who added them will be kept
untouched. In addition, the users following the playlists wonâ€™t be notified about changes in the playlists
when the tracks are reordered.

### Parameters

`playlist` - the spotify id or uri for the playlist.

`reorderRangeStart` - The position of the first track to be reordered.

`reorderRangeLength` - The amount of tracks to be reordered. Defaults to 1 if not set.
The range of tracks to be reordered begins from the range_start position, and includes the range_length subsequent tracks.
Example: To move the tracks at index 9-10 to the start of the playlist, range_start is set to 9, and range_length is set to 2.

`insertionPoint` - The position where the tracks should be inserted. To reorder the tracks to the end of the playlist, simply set insert_before to the position after the last track.

`snapshotId` - the playlist snapshot against which to apply this action. **recommended to have**

### Exceptions

`BadRequestException` - if the playlist is not found or illegal filters are applied
